How to run program: ./run in master branch 

The dataset is from Kaggle competition. 
This dataset contains a large number of body scans acquired by a new generation of millimeter wave scanner called the High Definition-Advanced Imaging Technology (HD-AIT) system.  The data for is more than three terabytes in size in total. Consider the platform I am working on. I will begin with  
_.aps = projected image angle sequence file (10.3MB per file) 
It is small-but-complete set of image files. 
After that I will look for other platform to deal with larger files with better resolution.


 Problem I would like to solve is how to predict threat through scan graph. 

 I would like to apply TensorFlow (deep learning) to solve the problem. Neural network works extremely well to solve problem of graph classification problem.
